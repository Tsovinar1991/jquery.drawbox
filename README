DrawBox is a jQuery plug-in that allows you to create a very simple canvas for drawing.

The plug-in was originally conceived and designed to collect signatures via an iPad as well as the web.  The plug-in has started to grow iand now includes a color selection option.

The raw SVG data for the drawing is stored in a hidden input element which is named %ID%-data, where %ID% is the ID of the canvas element that DrawBox was attached.

If you're unfortunate enough to have to support this plug-in in Internet Explorer, please use explorercanvas (included in the excanvas_r3 directory) http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/

Should you have any issues, or feedback, please contact me.
